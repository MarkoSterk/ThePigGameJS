A simple game for two players where each player rolls the dice until they accumulate 100 points. 

When it is your turn you can roll the dice until you have 100 points, OR, until you throw a 1. In this case (a 1) you loose all the points you got in that turn. You can, however, choose to hold onto your points in any given turn by stoping (clicking "hold") before you throw a 1.
